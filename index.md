# What I Learned Today
February 2021

## 1/31/2021
Including the last day of January since that is when I decided to formally keep track of "what I learned today".

Linear Algebra review: Learned the formal representation of Real vector spaces as the set of all n-tuples with Real valued components and how to represent that using Latex
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_{1} \\
    x_{2} \\
    \vdots \\
    x_{n}
\end{bmatrix} \space
\epsilon \space
\mathbb{R}^n
$$


```python

```
